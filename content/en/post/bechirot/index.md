After an unprecedented fifth general election in four years for Israel's Knesset (parliament), everyone was expecting another close result. Instead, the faction allied to the erstwhile prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ended up with a strong (by Israeli standards) majority of 65 seats out of 120. Meanwhile, the venerable left-wing Meretz party will have no members in the Knesset for the first time since its founding in 199? [tktk], and the unsubtly racist Otzma Yehudit [Jewish Power] party, until a couple of years ago on the outer fringes of Israeli politics, has 7 [tktk] seats.

What happened? Tom Friedman stopped talking to the nearest taxi driver long enough to proclaim "the end of the Israel we knew" [tktk].

Those who didn't panic did notice that the number of votes for the two factions (pro- and anti-Bibi) were very similar, and only a treacherous vote threshold caused two anti-Bibi parties (including the aforementioned venerable Meretz) to fail to win any seats, rather than a literal collapse to zero votes. Meretz were judged to have gotten xxx,xxx [tktk] valid votes, only xx,xxx votes away from clambering over the threshold.

Fair enough. However, this still doesn't answer the question: _why_ did Meretz fall below the threshold for the first time ever? And why did Otzma Yehudit grow so much? Could it be that the broken-clock columnist Friedman called the alarm correctly for once, and Israel is now a fascist wasteland?

Thank goodness we have granular voting data and the skills to analyze them to try to answer these questions.

Thanks to our friends at [Public Data Market](https://publicdatamarket.com), we have clean voting data from the 1999 elections to this most recent one. [Go sign up and download your own copy of the data for free now too](https://publicdatamarket.com/israeldata/bechirot).

To understand how parties' fortunes have changed, it's necessary to quickly remember how Israeli elections work.

In Israel, parties submit closed lists for election, and these lists can be combinations from multiple parties. The lists are represented by symbols composed of up to four Hebrew letters. (There are also symbols made up of equivalent Arab letters). For obvious reasons, these letters stay consistent between elections with few exceptions. For example, Bibi's Likud has used the symbol מחל‎ since its founding in 1973. Conversely, though, letters that represented defunct lists can be taken by others, so that a symbol does not necessarily represent the same group of parties.

Relatedly, a list of multiple parties can split up between elections, so that a much lower vote total for a particular symbol might be because it represents fewer parties on that occasion. For example,
